# code39

## Generate code 39 barcodes using native html and css in React.

Mappings have been painstakingly hardcoded.

Let me know if there is an algorithmic way.

[Demo App](https://lwxcode39.web.app/)


## As a react library
#### Install using npm:
> npm i @lwxatgt/barcode

```js
import Barcode from '@lwxatgt/barcode'
...
<Barcode value="some value" />
```
